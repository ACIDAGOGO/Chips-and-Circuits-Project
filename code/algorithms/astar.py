# 1. Add the starting square (or node) to the open list.

# 2. Repeat the following:

# A) Look for the lowest F cost square on the open list. We refer to this as the current square.

# B). Switch it to the closed list.

# C) For each of the 8 squares adjacent to this current square …

# If it is not walkable or if it is on the closed list, ignore it. Otherwise do the following.
# If it isn’t on the open list, add it to the open list. Make the current square the parent of this square. Record the F, G, and H costs of the square.
# If it is on the open list already, check to see if this path to that square is better, using G cost as the measure. A lower G cost means that this is a better path. If so, change the parent of the square to the current square, and recalculate the G and F scores of the square. If you are keeping your open list sorted by F score, you may need to resort the list to account for the change.
# D) Stop when you:

# Add the target square to the closed list, in which case the path has been found, or
# Fail to find the target square, and the open list is empty. In this case, there is no path.
# 3. Save the path. Working backwards from the target square, go from each square to its parent square until you reach the starting square. That is your path.
